Philly Home of the original creators of graff Dedicated to all those fallen soldiers 
praez gone to soon my heart is shattered my soul died with him
praez family by honor loyalty love
brother and mainly teacher
his name will be remembered for many years to come 
his death put our lives at a standstill
praez touched the hearts and lives of too many too name
his love and compassion for any human being no matter who they were homeless political race culture etc was pure love an compassion for all of them
A tribute to a man who's name deserves to live on Presidents die and are place on money And to me this man was better then a President he was the King of Philadelphia with more then just art
